    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">
        <p>Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability
            to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is
            sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6]
            unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different
            languages for the server- versus client-side programming.</p>
