    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)">
        <p>Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes
            reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle
            of don't repeat yourself.[8] Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django
            also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated
            dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.</p>
