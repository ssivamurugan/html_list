    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Boot">
        <p>Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework used for programming standalone, production-grade Spring-based
            applications with a bundle of libraries that make project startup and management easier.[3] Spring Boot is a
            convention-over-configuration extension for the Spring Java platform intended to help minimize configuration
            concerns while creating Spring-based applications.[4][5] The application can still be adjusted for specific
            needs, but the initial Spring Boot project provides a preconfigured "opinionated view" of the best
            configuration to use with the Spring platform and selected third-party libraries</p>
