    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-timeâ€“compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
