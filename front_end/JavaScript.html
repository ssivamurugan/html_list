        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm programming language. It has
            become a standard for creating interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. JavaScript
            is also used in server-side development, game development, and the creation of mobile applications.</p>
